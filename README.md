# Custom Corne layout.

[KeyMap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/)

The wired corne was built using PCB, diodes, and hot swap sockets from boardsource, controlled by the NiceNano pulled from my old Lily58. 
May install LEDs per key as this config is wired to the device via USB-C and to the right via TRRS, but underglow likely will not work once I install layters of acoustic foam. The switches do feature passthrough for the south-facing LEDs, and could add LED control to and additional layer.

This layer is intended for:
#### Mouse Support
Because this layer is toggleable, it allows the user to toggle the layer then use the mouse. On my mac machine, I have right-click disabled on my mouse, so to access right click features, I use C-click. This layer maps the Control key to the left side, to enabel right handed mouse usage.

#### Sticky Nums and Nav
Toggle this layer to access nums and nav without holding to access the Nav Layer.
